# Changelog

## 1.0.0-rc.2 — documentation candidate

- Correct release status throughout the source distribution: RC1 was published on 2026-10-21. Pin working download/verification commands to the published RC1 assets and distinguish a source snapshot from an uploaded release.
- Record exact RC1 CI/package/download verification without treating it as evidence for a later commit or as human/hardware sign-off. Keep all first-stable acceptance gates open where still pending.
- Advance VERSION for a distinct candidate package. Migration behavior, schemas, locale catalogs, confirmation defaults and safety checks are unchanged. Existing RC1 and 3.x tags/assets remain intact; no replacement upload is intended.

## 1.0.0-rc.1 — 2026-10-21 — published release candidate

- Begin the first stable release sequence at 1.0.0-rc.1, continuing the 3.3.0-dev.6 implementation. This is a one-time numbering reset; 1.x sorts below historical 3.x versions. Existing historical tags/assets remain unchanged. RC1 is a published pre-release, not GitHub Latest.
- Keep CLI behavior, schema versions, offline operation, backups, identity and migration safeguards unchanged. Add a synthetic cross-version saved-source/restore regression using higher-numbered 3.x metadata.
- Reconcile current package links and localization status, document version/backup compatibility and consolidate explicit first-stable acceptance gates. Record only generic scoped device evidence; private reports and real backups remain local.
- Local candidate validation: 185 synthetic tests (including the cross-version regression and actual macOS ditto fixture), self-test, 3x371 locale checks, index/worktree/history privacy, 84 documentation file links, 30 anchors and 30 shell examples passed. All six exact merged-main CI jobs passed for `aaedb78f2b2233ffe91ad42ae8ea9fb312860052`. The 35-file package matched that commit and both published assets were downloaded and verified. Stable acceptance remains pending.
- Stable publication still requires remaining acceptance, exact-candidate checks and separate approval. RC1 publication does not authorize another device operation or release.

## 3.3.0-dev.6 — 2026-10-19 — published experimental pre-release

- Catalog all remaining owned runtime errors, per-file status/progress, maintenance/cleanup reasons, scan/plugin warnings, self-test notices and custom argument-combination checks. Add 123 explicit message contracts (371 entries per locale).
- Preserve English exception/reason/warning/lock-label strings and machine records while displaying structured translations. Keep grouped recovery details structured; display-only booleans localize without changing English logs or stored bool values.
- Complete an independent editorial terminology pass for the three catalogs. Human wording and end-to-end acceptance are deferred to the combined final round; bootstrap/framework/external diagnostics retain original text by design.
- Add source-coverage and temporary-fixture regressions for protection rules, data equivalence, warnings, per-file comparison, unsafe archives, CLI refusals, command/recovery details and lock refusal. Combined local validation passed 184 tests (nine new), self-test, 3x371 locales and privacy/whitespace checks, plus 73 doc file links and 30 shell examples. All six exact merged-main jobs subsequently passed. The published package later passed a connected-device KOREADER transfer with full manifest verification, TARGET identity preservation and safe eject; startup and opening an existing book were confirmed. FULL preview refused insufficient space before writes. Broader human/hardware acceptance remains pending; private device data and backups are excluded from public records.
- Published as an experimental pre-release after approval, with a source ZIP and SHA256SUMS only. No runtime dependency, migration mode or confirmation/write/rollback safety decision changed.

## 3.3.0-dev.5 — internal snapshot included in 3.3.0-dev.6 — KM-014 workflow and recovery slice 3

- Translate core migration/saved-source/target-restore plans, archive/backup/verification/eject/identity notices, recovery guidance, five cancellation reasons and 36 selected refusals through the console/English-log adapter.
- Add 117 static entries/explicit placeholder contracts per locale (248 total), including archive subprocess heartbeats. Preserve exception string args in English; render structured IDs only at presentation and label unconverted integrated diagnostic details without changing the original log text.
- Report pre-run interruption once while retaining exit 130. Preserve migration decisions, identity guards, write/rollback branches, capacity/integrity checks, machine schemas and confirmation defaults.
- Add nine synthetic error/recovery regressions covering successful/blocked/failed rollback, exact-restore undo/guard, raw Unicode diagnostics, preserved English args and refusal before device access. Local validation passed 175 tests (nine new), self-test, 3x248 locale validation and publication worktree/history/whitespace checks. Subsequently merged as PR #8 with all 12 push/PR and six merged-main jobs passed. Human wording/hardware acceptance remains pending.
- Low-level/maintenance errors and detailed scanner/comparison output still need extraction. This is not full translation, hardware acceptance or a new published release.

## 3.3.0-dev.4 — internal snapshot included in 3.3.0-dev.6 — KM-014 menus and inspection slice 2

- Translate mode/identity/conflict menus, physical-model hints/confirmation, inspection fields and backup/target capacity reports through the shared console/English-log adapter.
- Add a LIBRARY capacity summary while retaining its existing free-space formula and refusal before TARGET backup/writes. Preserve numeric choices/defaults, unavailable identity retry, FULL/KOREADER conflict restrictions and physical-model confirmation.
- Add 37 static messages per locale (131 total); retain model/version/path/serial-hint values and stable machine tokens. Localize display-only yes/no/unknown labels.
- Remove the plugin-specific AI Assistant configuration indicator from console output and diagnostic logs; retain legacy snapshot metadata, generic plugin audits and whole-runtime file verification.
- Add synthetic multilingual menu/default/inspection/model and capacity-boundary regressions. Local validation passed 166 tests (12 new), self-test, 3x131 locale and privacy checks. Subsequently merged as PR #7 with all 12 push/PR and six merged-main CI jobs passed. Human review remains pending. Detailed errors/metadata/plugin/remaining workflow text is not fully translated; no new public release or hardware acceptance.


## 3.3.0-dev.3 — internal snapshot included in 3.3.0-dev.6 — KM-014 shared output routing slice 1

- Introduce explicit message IDs/parameter contracts and scoped console/English-log rendering. Integrated messages bypass the legacy tee, preserve output channels, flush progress, support non-UTF-8 consoles and never log typed answers.
- Integrate shared confirmations, progress, run status, catalog/cleanup headings and difference labels; retain English string compatibility for existing helpers. Add 58 static messages per locale (94 total); full workflow extraction and human wording review remain pending.
- Add optional ui_locale to run.json/difference.json; localize difference.txt while retaining stable category/action tokens and original paths. Old records remain readable.
- Add synthetic routing, prompt/default/token, all-mode/saved-source/restore equivalence, cancellation, interrupt and rollback tests across en/zh-Hant/zh-Hans. Device semantics and offline standalone requirements remain unchanged.
- Local validation: 154 tests (16 new shared-output/workflow cases), self-test, 3x94 locale and publication checks passed. Hosted CI and human translation/hardware acceptance remain pending.
- This is a local development slice, not a new published release or completion of KM-014/KM-015/manual hardware acceptance.

## Maintainer tooling and documentation — included in 3.3.0-dev.6

- Add offline `scripts/prepare_release.py` prepare/verify commands for explicit Git commits: guarded committed files only, complete runtime/locale assets, ZIP-to-Git byte verification, temporary-extraction smoke checks and local documentation links, SHA256SUMS and local preparation records.
- Add synthetic source-package safety regressions and CI package preparation. Existing output directories are not overwritten; the helper has no upload, tag or device-operation commands.
- Reconcile published pre-release, hosted CI and scoped hardware evidence across the README, tracker and guides. This does not complete pending manual acceptance, change migration behavior or replace the already published asset.
- Maintainer follow-up validation: 138 local tests (15 package regressions), self-test, locale and publication checks passed; merged PR #5 main CI passed all six jobs.

## 3.3.0-dev.2 — 2026-10-18 — published experimental pre-release

- Explicitly close read-only statistics connections after diagnostics, including error exits. SQLite transaction context management alone does not close a connection and can leave the migration process blocking safe eject.
- Tolerate already-removed descendants during KOReader tree replacement, rollback and restore on older supported Python versions. Keep missing-root, permission and symlink errors visible. This handles disappearing macOS AppleDouble entries without suppressing other deletion errors.
- Add synthetic removal-race, permission, missing-root and symlink regressions.
- Add retained-connection regressions for successful and invalid-database diagnostics, verifying deterministic closure and unchanged fixture bytes.
- Validation: 123 local tests, self-test, locale validation and publication checks passed. Connected-device source capture, verified target recovery and saved-source KOREADER transfer completed with full manifest verification; basic KOReader operation was subsequently confirmed. The exact release commit passed all six [main CI jobs](https://github.com/gh-slee/kobo-koreader-migrate/actions/runs/39155468946). The [experimental pre-release](https://github.com/gh-slee/kobo-koreader-migrate/releases/tag/v3.3.0-dev.2) is published; broader hardware acceptance and FULL book migration remain pending.

## Publication guard follow-up — 2026-10-15 — subsequently merged

- Diagnosed PR-only CI rejection of GitHub's public merge committer address. Approved branch push CI passed all six macOS/Linux and Python 3.9/3.12/3.14 jobs.
- Permit exact `noreply@github.com` only as a merge committer; user noreply authors, all file/content/history scans and personal-email rejection remain required.
- Added real Git-history fixtures covering seven allowed/rejected identity cases. All 115 tests, self-test and locale validation passed locally. The guard follow-up was subsequently merged into main; physical acceptance remains separate from automated checks and PR merge.

## 3.3.0-dev.1 — 2026-10-15 — KM-013 foundation; ready for user testing

- Added offline JSON locale registry/catalogs for en, zh-Hant and zh-Hans, explicit/environment selection, script-aware aliases and safe English fallback.
- Added localized help descriptions, --list-locales and a read-only --preview-ui sample. Actual migration/maintenance UI and diagnostic logs remain English; full localization is pending KM-014/KM-015.
- Added bounded UTF-8/schema/duplicate-key/placeholder/control-character/plural validation, exact locale-file publication allowlist, validator CLI and CI/publish-helper checks.
- 114 tests passed locally, including existing archive/migration regressions and equivalent temporary FULL outcomes in all three locale choices. Standalone self-test passed. No real Kobo was accessed or migrated, no real backups were deleted, and no physical-device acceptance was inferred. This batch was subsequently published for review as PR #1 after explicit approval.

## 3.2.0 — 2026-10-14 — Public preparation; physical acceptance pending

- Replaced fixed model-pair direction with operator-confirmed SOURCE/TARGET roles; log model labels are hints, not hardware verification.
- Discover renamed Kobo volumes by safe .kobo directory markers; require device fingerprints and explicit runtime compatibility confirmation.
- Saved-source/target-restore workflows accept confirmed model labels without inferring an opposite model. Existing archive names/snapshots remain usable.
- Added detailed generic documentation, MIT license, privacy ignore/allowlist/index/history checks, pre-push guard, fixture CI and standalone feature-branch PR helper.
- FULL, KOREADER, LIBRARY, AUDIT and conservative cleanup/rollback behavior retained.

## 3.1.0 — 2026-10-12 — Ready for user testing

- KM-011: OS-backed project/device locks, atomic run.json status and interruption reconciliation.
- KM-005: detailed text/JSON migration differences, target-only inventory in the same supported scope and book/sidecar grouping.
- KM-001: verified saved source reuse, reference/dependency tracking and distinct exact TARGET snapshot restoration for v3.1+ runs; legacy source imports are conservative.
- KM-003: run catalog, retention/dependency/recovery protections, read-only cleanup preview and explicit typed batch deletion.
- Added tests for cross-process locks, archive integrity, source reuse, exact restore and restore rollback, cleanup protection and actual macOS ditto fixture workflow.
- Existing FULL, KOREADER, LIBRARY and AUDIT semantics retained. Physical Kobo validation and human sign-off are pending.

## 3.0.4 — Existing baseline

Normal cancellation messaging, file/byte progress, stable project-relative script and per-run output folders; 45 portable regression tests passed before this release.
