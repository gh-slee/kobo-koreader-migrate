# Agent instructions

This is the shared project guidance for coding agents. Human usage belongs in README.md; contribution workflow belongs in CONTRIBUTING.md. The product is a macOS Python 3.9+ CLI using only the standard library, JSON locale catalogs and unittest; Linux CI checks fixtures only.

## Find task context

- Read the current code and the documentation relevant to the requested change. Use README.md for quick start, docs/USAGE.md for CLI behavior, docs/RECOVERY.md for backup/restore, docs/DEVELOPMENT.md for implementation/testing, docs/MAINTAINING.md for publication, TRACKER.md for feature criteria and ACCEPTANCE.md for manual acceptance.
- Work only within the requested scope. A backlog entry is not authorization to operate devices, delete backups or start another feature.
- Follow existing standard-library patterns: pathlib for paths, argparse for CLI options and unittest with temporary fixtures. Keep machine schemas and stable CLI tokens compatible.
- Public code, identifiers, comments and canonical developer docs use English. Translate owned UI text only through reviewed locale catalogs; diagnostic logs and machine schemas stay English.

## Runtime and data safety

- Every feature must run offline as ordinary code without an LLM, AI API, model download, agent framework or active development session. AI assistance is for development only.
- Preserve FULL, KOREADER, LIBRARY, AUDIT and dry-run. FULL includes supported books, reading data and default root fonts; KOREADER copies only the entire KOReader tree.
- FULL/KOREADER replace the whole runtime after backup. Retain TARGET-only library files outside that tree. FULL rejects selective library scopes and keep-target conflicts.
- Keep SOURCE read-only. Before TARGET writes, require identity checks, compatibility/role confirmations, sufficient space, verified source archives and TARGET rollback backups.
- Device model logs are hints, not hardware proof. Require readable fingerprints and reject the same device in both roles.
- Never evaluate device Lua or execute copied plugins. Keep path, ZIP, symlink, integrity, lock and rollback protections intact.
- Keep normal cancellation distinct from migration and recovery errors. Do not selectively preserve hardware settings or merge reading metadata without an implemented, tested policy.
- Keep the stable filename kobo-koreader-migrate.py; record versions in code/logs/JSON. Generated data stays in runs/<run-id>/ under the selected project root.
- Runtime UI after locale loading uses explicit catalog IDs for owned errors/prompts/progress/warnings/cleanup reasons and custom parser checks. Keep exception args, saved warning/reason strings, machine tokens and diagnostic logs English. Preserve structured children through diagnostic_detail/join_diagnostics; never infer IDs from rendered text. Raw external diagnostics, Python parser/traceback text and locale-bootstrap failures are deliberate original-text boundaries. Human wording/hardware acceptance remains pending.

## Verify changes

For runtime, catalog, test or publication-guard changes, run the relevant checks:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_locales.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
python3 kobo-koreader-migrate.py --self-test
python3 scripts/check_publication.py --worktree --history
```

- Use disposable temporary fixtures. Tests have no authorization to access physical Kobos or delete real recovery data. Run the macOS ditto fixture when changing archive/restore behavior.
- Match validation to the change. For documentation-only work, check links, CLI examples and privacy; do not repeat unrelated runtime tests without a reason.
- Report observed evidence and remaining limits. Fixture/CI success is not physical-device validation. Keep acceptance tickets Ready for test until human sign-off.

## Deliver and publish

- Keep the public tracker, acceptance status and relevant docs current. Update the version/changelog when runtime behavior changes.
- Keep credentials, books, device data, runs and local instructions out of Git. Stage explicit public paths; inspect staged blobs and reachable history with the publication guard.
- Obtain appropriate user authorization before external publication or other consequential actions. Use a feature branch and PR; no automatic merge, force push, remote deletion or release publishing.
- Before a permitted push, verify origin and use scripts/publish.py with the exact OWNER/REPO and a reviewed English PR body. Never bypass a failing publication guard.
- Start fresh sessions in the repository. Use the [session verification prompt](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#fresh-session-verification); distinguish discovered instructions from explicit reads and static checks from actual session/worktree tests. Verify destination branch and guidance after a worktree transfer.
- If delegation is requested, give each agent a bounded task and the applicable instructions/context; do not assume every tool inherits the parent's full conversation. Delegation does not broaden permissions.
